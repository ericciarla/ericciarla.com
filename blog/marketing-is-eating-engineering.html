        <h1>Marketing Is Eating Engineering</h1>

        <p>
            The majority of open roles we have right now at Firecrawl are on the go-to-market side. We're still hiring engineers, and we're not going to stop, but the ratio has shifted in a way that would have seemed insane a year ago for an AI infrastructure company like ours.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason is pretty simple. A growing amount of our code is now AI-written. We use <a href="https://devin.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devin</a> directly in Slack and even built an internal tool called Spring that's a remote Claude Code instance connected to all of our codebases. In about six months, Devin and Spring combined have become the second highest contributor of code to our web app behind my co-founder and CTO Nick, with over 500 commits.
        </p>

        <p>
            We're not unique here. A quarter of the startups in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Y Combinator's Winter 2025 batch</a> shipped products where 95% of the code was written by AI. This is happening everywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
            When AI makes every engineer dramatically more productive, you still need great engineers, maybe more than ever, because the ceiling on what a small team can build is so much higher. But the ratio shifts. You can ship an amazing product with fewer people, and the bottleneck moves to the things that are harder to replicate like distribution, partnerships, regulation, and trust.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cost of shipping software is dropping to near zero, and what you get is an explosion of apps and tools solving overlapping problems. The supply side of software is going to become completely saturated. <a href="https://www.phoenixstrategy.group/blog/cac-trends-growth-stage-companies-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Average SaaS customer acquisition costs were already rising roughly 14% in 2024</a>, and that's only going to accelerate as more products hit the market. Getting in front of customers through new discovery engines like AI agents, ChatGPT, social media, and whatever comes next is going to require really smart people.
        </p>

        <p>
            DocuSign is a good example. The actual technology behind e-signatures is not particularly complex. Anyone could clone the core DocuSign experience in a weekend now, and hundreds probably already have. But DocuSign has the enterprise contracts, the brand trust, the integrations, the muscle memory of millions of people who just associate "sign a document" with that company. They still need engineers to keep the product excellent, but the moat is the relationships and brand, not the code itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be clear, AI is eating go-to-market too. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/vercel-ai-sales-agents-jeanne-grosser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel replaced its 10-person inbound SDR team with a single employee and an AI agent in six weeks</a> and held their conversion rate flat. AI multiplies everything, but right now it's multiplying engineering output faster than anything else. The caveat on both sides is taste. The engineer behind the agent needs to know what good code and a good user experience actually look like. The marketer needs to know what's actually going to resonate with the target market, and more and more, they need to know how to build too. The marketers who can ship a landing page in Claude Code or wire up their own automations on top of doing traditional GTM are becoming absurdly leveraged. Our PMM ships full web pages with Claude Code, does their own design work in Figma, and handles traditional product marketing. That kind of person barely existed two years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
            The moats that matter in a saturated market (distribution, brand, ecosystem partnerships, customer trust) live on the GTM side, whether you're building relationships with people or making sure your product is the one agents reach for. And as software gets cheaper to ship and more products flood the market, that work is only getting more valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
            We're doubling down on this at Firecrawl. We're investing heavily in brand, integrations, partnerships, and building relationships that entrench us in the ecosystem and in people's applications. The biggest problem we're solving right now isn't technical. It's making sure that humans and agents choose Firecrawl over the alternatives that could do something similar.
        </p>

        <p>
            The big engineering salaries of the past decade aren't going away, especially for exceptional engineers solving genuinely hard problems. At Firecrawl, we're by no means stopping hiring engineers. The product is the foundation and we need the best people making it better. But the ratio of GTM and other non-engineering roles is going up, and I think that's true across the industry. The skill of selling, marketing, positioning, and getting people to actually use your product is going to be one of the most valuable skills of the next decade. It's why I feel lucky to be leading marketing at Firecrawl right now. I'm learning more about what it takes to win attention in a crowded market than I ever could have in a world where engineering was the bottleneck. The companies that figure this out first, the ones that invest in high-leverage GTM talent alongside their engineering teams rather than as an afterthought, are going to have a massive advantage in a market that's about to get very, very crowded.
