        <h1>Why We Stopped Chasing Micro-Influencers (and What Creator Density Taught Us)</h1>

        <p>
            We've worked with a ton of influencers at Firecrawl, big and small, millions of impressions across both. The large creators consistently outperformed. I hadn't expected it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gamma is the counterexample I wanted to be true. They've grown to roughly <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110805751/en/Gamma-Surpasses-%24100M-ARR-Raises-at-%242.1B-Valuation-as-It-Replaces-PowerPoint-for-the-AI-Era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million users with hundreds of millions of decks and docs created</a>. And Gamma is also a Firecrawl customer. Jon Noronha, Gamma's founder, <a href="https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/how-gamma-supercharges-onboarding-with-firecrawl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about using Firecrawl in production</a> to convert URLs into clean markdown for their product.
        </p>

        <p>
            More importantly, Gamma's leadership has <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-8tw3i-28b6ac29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked openly about leaning into micro-influencers</a> instead of big-name sponsorships. Over 1,000 creators, with heavy investment in onboarding so each creator could tell the story in their own voice.
        </p>

        <p>
            We tried to copy their playbook. It didn't work for us.
        </p>

        <p>
            The real difference is what I'd call creator density. Gamma makes presentation software and almost anyone can authentically demo it. A teacher, a founder, a recruiter, a fitness coach. The creator pool is enormous because the product fits into a lot of "normal" content. Firecrawl is web data infrastructure for agents and developers. Our audience is narrower, more technical, and much less forgiving when content is wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dev tools can still benefit from creator-led growth. Supabase runs an <a href="https://supabase.dev/docs/supasquad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official advocate program</a>, and Cursor has described growth spreading heavily via word-of-mouth (we run a <a href="https://www.firecrawl.dev/creator-oss-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creator program</a> for smaller creators with challenges and assets they can build with too, though we're not managing it on an individual basis). But a <em>paid</em> micro-influencer program where you're actively recruiting and managing dozens of small creators is a fundamentally different operation when your creator-fit pool is smaller. Our pool was especially small because we weren't looking for mid-roll ad reads. We wanted creators who would actually integrate Firecrawl into their content and build with it, which narrows the field even more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then there's the coordination tax, which nobody likes to say out loud.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dev micro-creators exist. The issue is finding them, vetting them, onboarding them, getting deliverables, reviewing for technical accuracy, and chasing timelines. All of it's a real workload. Paying 20 creators $1k each isn't "one campaign." It's 20 mini-campaigns.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we looked at the results honestly, the micro-influencers were generating impressions but not signups. The bigger creators drove real conversions; the smaller ones mostly generated views that didn't go anywhere. Creator density showed up in the metrics. Gamma's micro-influencers drove signups because their audiences were full of potential users. Ours weren't. At the micro level, the overlap with developers who would actually use a web data API just wasn't there.
        </p>

        <p>
            So we flipped the approach entirely. Fewer creators, bigger reach, deeper relationships. The real investment goes toward the bigger names, which have had more effect for us. What surprised us was the second-order effect. When a major creator in the dev tools space posts about Firecrawl, smaller creators notice and start making their own content without us asking or paying. One large partnership seeds a wave of organic follow-on posts that you never could have coordinated manually.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second-order effect sold us on the approach long term. I don't think it's the right call for every company. Both strategies work. The real question is which one your team can actually execute. Which depends on your target audience, creator pool, and goals.
